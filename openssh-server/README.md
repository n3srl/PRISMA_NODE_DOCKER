OpenSSH server Docker image
===========================

Same as [linuxserver/docker-openssh-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openssh-server) but with docker library installed (Docker in Docker) and default port on 22 (instead of 2222) and with the addition of a list of pre-defined allowed keys and the prisma.sh script.
